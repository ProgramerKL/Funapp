# PRD: Guess the Hangman Game

## Executive Summary
A digital version of the classic Hangman word game, designed for single-player play in short bursts. The player must guess letters in a hidden word before exceeding the maximum number of wrong guesses. The game emphasizes fast play, clear visuals, and replayability.

**Target Audience:** Casual gamers aged 8-65  
**Platform:** Web-based (primary), mobile-responsive  
**Development Timeline:** 4-6 weeks  
**Success Metrics:** 70%+ game completion rate, <3s load time, 80%+ player retention after first game

## User Stories & Acceptance Criteria

### Epic 1: Core Gameplay
**As a player, I want to guess letters to reveal a hidden word so that I can win the game.**

- **Story 1.1:** Letter Selection
  - Given I am playing the game, when I click on an unguessed letter, then it should be marked as guessed and cannot be selected again
  - Given the letter exists in the word, when I guess it, then all instances of that letter should be revealed simultaneously
  - Given the letter does not exist in the word, when I guess it, then one hangman body part should be drawn

- **Story 1.2:** Game State Management
  - Given I have guessed all letters in the word, when the word is complete, then I should see a win screen with my score
  - Given I have made 6 incorrect guesses, when the hangman is fully drawn, then I should see a lose screen with the correct word revealed
  - Given I want to play again, when I click the reset button, then a new word should be selected and the game state should reset

### Epic 2: Scoring System
**As a player, I want to earn points for correct guesses so that I can track my performance.**

- **Story 2.1:** Point Calculation
  - Given I guess a correct letter, when it's revealed, then I should earn 10 points per letter instance
  - Given I complete a word, when I win, then I should earn a 50-point bonus
  - Given I make an incorrect guess, when it's processed, then I should lose 5 points (minimum 0)

- **Story 2.2:** High Score Persistence
  - Given I complete a game, when my score is calculated, then it should be saved to local storage if it's a new high score
  - Given I start the game, when it loads, then I should see my current high score displayed

## Core Gameplay
- A random word is selected from a preloaded word bank.  
- Word is displayed as underscores representing letters.  
- Player guesses letters one at a time by selecting from an on-screen alphabet.  
- Correct guesses reveal the letters in their positions.  
- Incorrect guesses draw one part of the hangman figure.  
- Game ends when:  
  - Player guesses the full word (win).  
  - Hangman is fully drawn (loss).  

## Controls
- On-Screen Keyboard A–Z → Tap to guess a letter.  
- Reset Button → Start new word or game.  

## Scoring and Progression
- +10 points per correct letter.  
- +50 bonus points for completing the word.  
- -5 points per wrong guess.  
- High score leaderboard displayed for replay motivation.  

## Visuals
- Word Display → Large text with underscores for hidden letters.  
- Hangman Area → Each wrong guess adds a body part to the figure (6–8 steps).  
- Keyboard Layout → Simple A–Z grid with guessed letters grayed out.  
- Feedback → Correct guesses flash green, wrong guesses flash red.  

## Audio and Feedback
- Correct guess → short confirmation sound.  
- Wrong guess → error sound and hangman part appears.  
- Win → cheerful sound and celebration animation.  
- Lose → fail sound and sad animation.  

## Word Bank
- Preloaded list of 150–200 words.  
- Difficulty tiers:  
  - Easy: 3–5 letters (cat, tree, book)  
  - Medium: 6–8 letters (planet, rocket, flower)  
  - Hard: 9+ letters (mountains, discovery, computer)  
- Words chosen randomly per round.

## Edge Cases & Error Handling

### Gameplay Edge Cases
- **Repeated Letter Guesses:** Clicking an already guessed letter should provide visual feedback but not affect game state or score
