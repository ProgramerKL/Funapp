Weak insults make the AI happier, while strong insults provoke counter-attacks.\n\nInsult Quality Detection:\n- Weak (quality 1): Single basic insult word with short message\n- Decent (quality 2): Multiple insults, comparisons, or medium-length creative attempts\n- Strong (quality 3): Long creative insults with multiple descriptors or comparisons\n\nAI Response Behavior:\n- Weak insults: AI mocks the player and becomes HAPPIER (upset level -10)\n- Decent insults: AI insults back 70% of the time\n- Strong insults: AI insults back 90% of the time\n\nWeak Insult Responses (by mood level):\n- Calm: \"Is that supposed to be an insult?
